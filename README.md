# Multi Folder Workspace Opener

A VS Code extension that lets you select multiple project folders from anywhere on your system and open them together inside a single **multi-root workspace** — no manual `.code-workspace` editing required.

---

## ✨ Features

| Feature | Details |
|---|---|
| **Quick folder picker** | Opens native OS folder-selection dialogs one by one |
| **Configurable count** | Pick 2–10 folders per command invocation (setting) |
| **Duplicate detection** | Skips folders already in the workspace or already selected during the same run |
| **Save as workspace** | Optionally saves a persistent `.code-workspace` file |
| **Auto-save setting** | Skip the prompt and always save automatically |

---

## 📋 Requirements

- **VS Code** `1.75.0` or later
- **Node.js** `18` or later (for development/build only)

---

## 🚀 Quick Start (Running from Source)

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
cd "d:\vibe code\Multi Folder Workspace Opener"
npm install
```

### 2. Compile the Extension

```bash
npm run compile
```

This runs `tsc` and outputs compiled JavaScript to the `./out/` directory.

Or to watch for changes during development:

```bash
npm run watch
```

### 3. Run in Extension Development Host (F5)

1. Open the extension folder in VS Code:
   ```
   code "d:\vibe code\Multi Folder Workspace Opener"
   ```
2. Press **F5** (or go to **Run → Start Debugging**).
3. A new VS Code window opens — this is the **Extension Development Host**.
4. In that new window, open the **Command Palette** (`Ctrl+Shift+P`).
5. Type and select: **`Multi Folder Workspace: Open Folders in One Workspace`**
6. Follow the folder picker dialogs.

## ⚙️ Extension Settings

Configure in **Settings** (`Ctrl+,`) or in `settings.json`:

| Setting | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `multiFolderWorkspace.defaultFolderCount` | `number` | `2` | Number of folders to select (min: 2, max: 10) |
| `multiFolderWorkspace.autoSaveWorkspace` | `boolean` | `false` | Skip the save-prompt and always save a `.code-workspace` file |

**Example `settings.json`:**
```json
{
  "multiFolderWorkspace.defaultFolderCount": 3,
  "multiFolderWorkspace.autoSaveWorkspace": true
}
```

## 📦 Packaging with vsce

### Install vsce (if not already installed)

```bash
npm install -g @vscode/vsce
```

### Package the Extension

```bash
npm run vsce:package
# or
vsce package
```

This creates a `.vsix` file (e.g. `multi-folder-workspace-opener-1.0.0.vsix`) in the project root.

### Install the VSIX Locally

```bash
code --install-extension multi-folder-workspace-opener-1.0.0.vsix
```

Or via VS Code UI: Extensions panel → `...` → **Install from VSIX…**

## 🌐 Publishing to the VS Code Marketplace

### Prerequisites

1. Create a publisher account at [marketplace.visualstudio.com](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/manage).
2. Generate a **Personal Access Token (PAT)** in Azure DevOps with **Marketplace → Manage** scope.
3. Update `package.json` — set `"publisher"` to your publisher ID.

### Login and Publish

```bash
vsce login <your-publisher-name>
vsce publish
```

To publish a specific version:
```bash
vsce publish 1.0.0
```

> **Tip:** Bump the version in `package.json` before each publish, or use:
> ```bash
> vsce publish patch   # 1.0.0 → 1.0.1
> vsce publish minor   # 1.0.0 → 1.1.0
> vsce publish major   # 1.0.0 → 2.0.0
> ```
